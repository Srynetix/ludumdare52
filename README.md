Welcome on my 6th **Ludum Dare** Compo entry!

Once again, the theme was... not what I expected, but after a couple of minutes I had a stupid idea I wanted to build.  
So there you go:

> A local dude needs your help. He really like to eat and the poor guy has nothing left in his house.  
> But lucky him, he got fields full of stuff, ready to **harvest**!  
> The only thing he's missing is something special, that you, dear player, have to help him: a KEYBOARD!  
> So help him with your typing abilities, and bring him what he wants to make him happy again!

So yes, that's a **typing game**!  
It's quite easy at first, but *can be challenging after a while*, especially when you have to type words with more than 5 letters.  
And yes, **don't miss**. Miss a letter and *you have to restart from the beginning*! How fun!

After each item fetched from the ground, the game goes **faster**.  
Every **10** items, **a new letter is added** to the word you need to type.

You wanna win and beat the highscore?  
Well, if you can reach the **first** of the **7 letter** words you should be good. :wink:
